The healthcare industry faces a major challenge whan it comes to diagnosing diseases like cancer in the early stages.
Radiologists have to manually review medical images, which is time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to delayed or missed diagnoses
This leads to reduced patientsâ€™ outcomes and higher charges and duration of treatment.

The AI will employ convolutional neural networks to deprecated features, to automatically identify the initial stages of cancer in medical images such as CT scans or mammograms. 
Deep learning will help the system to give real-time feedback to radiologists and enhance the efficiency of identifying abnormalities up to 100%. 
This specific AI system will not only help in early diagnosis of diseases but also help in better treatment strategies for the patients.
