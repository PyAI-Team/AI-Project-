# Welcome to AI-Project-

## What is the project about
The project is about creating an Artificial Intelligence solution using Python to benefit a company or an industry of the organisations' choice.
## Tasks as per the project outline
1. Provide a detailed explanation of not more than one paragraph **explaining the extent to which your solution is relevant to the Theme**(“an AI Solution for Industries.”)
2. **Identify the problem** that leads to your proposed solution and write it
under problem definition sub-title in NO MORE than 250 words.
    - What exactly is the problem (190 words maximum)?
    - How will solving the problem using AI benefit local municipality (in case of a community)?
3. Clarify the main objective of your AI Solution. Provide details of how you are planning to apply AI in solving the problem.

## Initialising Python
In Python version 3.12.5, you might find that the `numpy` and `scikit-learn` modules that we're used to practise data preprocessing, are producing an error:

To potentially resolve this issue, you have to download and install these modules using your **command prompt** (assuming you have Python installed as shown by out lecturer)

1. For `numpy`,  type  `python -m pip install numpy` in your command prompt. It should look like this:

2. For `scikit-learn` or `sklearn`, type `python -m pip install scikit-learn` in your cmd.
