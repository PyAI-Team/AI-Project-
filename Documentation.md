# Breast Cancer Detection Using AI ‚Äì An AI Solution
Breast cancer detection is a crucial step in informing the type of treatment a patient must undergo and administering the wrong treatment does more harm than good to the patient.
Breast cancer detection using AI is a crucial tool in making informed decisions concerning tumour treatment; the model will establish whether a tumour is cancerous or non-cancerous, allowing doctors to make quick and informed decisions.

# Problem Definition
Breast cancer is one of the most common tumours globally, and early detection is important for effective treatment. The challenge is in diagnosing breast cancer from medical images such as mammograms. Sometimes mistakes are made and patients can end up receiving treatments they do not need at all or on the other extreme, they refrain from getting recommended treatment they need. This can be lethal especially when one contacts the cancer at a very early stage and early detection of cancer is very helpful.
This project addresses the need for a reliable, efficient, and accurate approach to detect breast cancer in medical photographs, hence lowering the chance of human mistake in diagnosis. The goal is to create an AI-powered solution that can automatically categorize breast cancers as cancerous or non-cancerous using deep learning techniques, allowing medical personnel to make more informed and timely decisions about patient care.
This problem is extremely relevant to the topic of using technology in businesses, particularly healthcare. By incorporating AI into the diagnostic process, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer detection. This is aligned with the Fourth Industrial Revolution's goal of leveraging modern technology to solve major problems in various industries.							           The project focuses on enhancing business operations in the healthcare industry by automating and augmenting the capabilities of doctors in diagnosing breast cancer.
Implementing an AI-based solution for breast cancer detection will provide several benefits. First it cuts down the high percentage of wrong diagnoses thus increasing the chances of early treatment for the diagnosed patients. Second, patients get diagnosed faster so that the doctors start making decisions faster. In conclusion, it can prevent the raising of high contraction costs that emanate from doing several tests and procedures on the patients. Lastly, it will ensure patients receive the right amount of care that was needed avoiding wastage of health care resource.
