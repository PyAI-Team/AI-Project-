### ⚠️Requirements, constraints and risks

**Requirements:** 

1. Data Requirements: - Access to a large dataset of breast cancer images or data (e.g., mammograms, biopsy results, etc.). - Data must include a variety of samples, both malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous). 
2. Modeling Requirements: - Selection of an appropriate AI/ML model (e.g., CNN for image analysis). - Ensure model training, validation, and testing follow best practices, such as cross-validation. 
3. Compliance and Ethics: - Compliance with medical data privacy standards such as Protection of Personal Information Act 
(POPIA), National Health Act (NHA) 61 of 2003, etc. - The National Health Research Ethics Council (NHREC) outlines ethical guidelines for conducting 
health research in South Africa, which includes the handling of medical data. 
4. User Interface: - Develop a user-friendly dashboard for doctors to easily interpret AI predictions. - Allow visual feedback and explanations  

**Constraints:** 

1. Data Privacy and Security: - Strict adherence to privacy laws when handling patient data. - Encryption and safe storage for personal medical records. 
2. Regulatory Approvals: - Any AI tool used in healthcare must meet regulations from health authorities such as the National 
Department of Health (NDoH), South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA), Health 
Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA). 
3. Time and Budget: - Allocating time to develop and test the AI model. - Budget constraints on acquiring data and software licenses.
   
**Risks:**

1. Ethical Risks: - Over-reliance on AI predictions could lead to improper treatments. - Potential bias in the AI model due to underrepresentation of certain demographic groups. 
2. Regulatory Risks: - Delays in regulatory approval could slow down the deployment of the system. - Not complaining with health data regulations could have legal or financial repercussions. 
3. User Adoption Risks: - Doctors and medical professionals to can choose not to adopt our AI-based tool without sufficient 
transparency or explanation. - Poor user interface design could hinder the adoption and usage by healthcare providers.


### 🛠️Assessment of Tools and Techniques
Tools
Python- Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together
TensorFlow/Keras: TensorFlow will be used to develop and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. CNNs are well-suited for image analysis, which is essential for accurately classifying mammograms in breast cancer detection.
Python Imaging Library: This tool will be used for image preprocessing, such as resizing, normalization, and enhancing mammogram images. Proper preprocessing ensures that the input data is in an optimal format for the deep learning model.
HTML and CSS: These tools wills be used to build the user-facing interface where healthcare professionals can interact with the AI system
Techniques
•	Convolutional Neural Networks: CNNs will be adopted as the main form of machine learning that will be used to identify and differentiate breast tumors from mammogram images. CNNs are useful when it comes to detecting the existence of the spatial hierarchy in the images, learning about patterns, characteristics of malignancy or benign tumour.
•	Transfer Learning: Given the challenge of limited medical image datasets, transfer learning will be applied. Pre-trained models will be fine-tuned on the breast cancer dataset, leveraging pre-learned features to boost performance while reducing the need for extensive data and training time.
•	Data Augmentation: To overcome the limitation of small medical datasets, data augmentation techniques will be applied.
•	Natural Language Processing: NLP will be utilized to develop a Chabot integrated with the system. This Chabot will help doctors and healthcare professionals by answering questions, guiding them through the process of uploading images, and interpreting results in a user-friendly manner.


# Problem Definition
Breast cancer is one of the most common tumours globally, and early detection is important for effective treatment. The challenge is in diagnosing breast cancer from medical images such as mammograms. Sometimes mistakes are made and patients can end up receiving treatments they do not need at all or on the other extreme, they refrain from getting recommended treatment they need. This can be lethal especially when one contacts the cancer at a very early stage and early detection of cancer is very helpful.
This project addresses the need for a reliable, efficient, and accurate approach to detect breast cancer in medical photographs, hence lowering the chance of human mistake in diagnosis. The goal is to create an AI-powered solution that can automatically categorize breast cancers as cancerous or non-cancerous using deep learning techniques, allowing medical personnel to make more informed and timely decisions about patient care.
This problem is extremely relevant to the topic of using technology in businesses, particularly healthcare. By incorporating AI into the diagnostic process, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer detection. This is aligned with the Fourth Industrial Revolution's goal of leveraging modern technology to solve major problems in various industries.							           The project focuses on enhancing business operations in the healthcare industry by automating and augmenting the capabilities of doctors in diagnosing breast cancer.
Implementing an AI-based solution for breast cancer detection will provide several benefits. First it cuts down the high percentage of wrong diagnoses thus increasing the chances of early treatment for the diagnosed patients. Second, patients get diagnosed faster so that the doctors start making decisions faster. In conclusion, it can prevent the raising of high contraction costs that emanate from doing several tests and procedures on the patients. Lastly, it will ensure patients receive the right amount of care that was needed avoiding wastage of health care resource.
