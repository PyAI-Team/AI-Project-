# Breast Cancer Detection Using AI ‚Äì An AI Solution
Breast cancer detection is a crucial step in informing the type of treatment a patient must undergo and administering the wrong treatment does more harm than good to the patient.
Breast cancer detection using AI is a crucial tool in making informed decisions concerning tumour treatment; the model will establish whether a tumour is cancerous or non-cancerous, allowing doctors to make quick and informed decisions.

# Business Objectives
### ‚úÖBusiness objectives

1. Improve Diagnostic Accuracy: Developing an AI model to detect whether a breat tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous), which will reduce the chances of incorrect diagnoses and enhance the acurracy of diagnoses

2. Faster Decesion-making: Allows doctors to make quiker, data-driven decisions by providing them with AI-generated understanding on breast tumor classifications.

3. Amplified Treatment Outcomes: Support better treatment planning by ensuring that the correct diagnosis is made, which helps avoid unneccessary treatments or delays in neccessary ones.

4. Cost Efficiency: Reduce the cost of the treatments by improving the efficiency of the diagnostic process, which reduces the need for more tests or surgeries.

### ‚ö†Ô∏èRequirements, constraints and risks

**Requirements:** 

1. Data Requirements: - Access to a large dataset of breast cancer images or data (e.g., mammograms, biopsy results, etc.). - Data must include a variety of samples, both malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous). 
2. Modeling Requirements: - Selection of an appropriate AI/ML model (e.g., CNN for image analysis). - Ensure model training, validation, and testing follow best practices, such as cross-validation. 
3. Compliance and Ethics: - Compliance with medical data privacy standards such as Protection of Personal Information Act 
(POPIA), National Health Act (NHA) 61 of 2003, etc. - The National Health Research Ethics Council (NHREC) outlines ethical guidelines for conducting 
health research in South Africa, which includes the handling of medical data. 
4. User Interface: - Develop a user-friendly dashboard for doctors to easily interpret AI predictions. - Allow visual feedback and explanations  

**Constraints:** 

1. Data Privacy and Security: - Strict adherence to privacy laws when handling patient data. - Encryption and safe storage for personal medical records. 
2. Regulatory Approvals: - Any AI tool used in healthcare must meet regulations from health authorities such as the National 
Department of Health (NDoH), South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA), Health 
Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA). 
3. Time and Budget: - Allocating time to develop and test the AI model. - Budget constraints on acquiring data and software licenses.
   
**Risks:**

1. Ethical Risks: - Over-reliance on AI predictions could lead to improper treatments. - Potential bias in the AI model due to underrepresentation of certain demographic groups. 
2. Regulatory Risks: - Delays in regulatory approval could slow down the deployment of the system. - Not complaining with health data regulations could have legal or financial repercussions. 
3. User Adoption Risks: - Doctors and medical professionals to can choose not to adopt our AI-based tool without sufficient 
transparency or explanation. - Poor user interface design could hinder the adoption and usage by healthcare providers.

# Problem Definition
Breast cancer is one of the most common tumours globally, and early detection is important for effective treatment. The challenge is in diagnosing breast cancer from medical images such as mammograms. Sometimes mistakes are made and patients can end up receiving treatments they do not need at all or on the other extreme, they refrain from getting recommended treatment they need. This can be lethal especially when one contacts the cancer at a very early stage and early detection of cancer is very helpful.
This project addresses the need for a reliable, efficient, and accurate approach to detect breast cancer in medical photographs, hence lowering the chance of human mistake in diagnosis. The goal is to create an AI-powered solution that can automatically categorize breast cancers as cancerous or non-cancerous using deep learning techniques, allowing medical personnel to make more informed and timely decisions about patient care.
This problem is extremely relevant to the topic of using technology in businesses, particularly healthcare. By incorporating AI into the diagnostic process, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer detection. This is aligned with the Fourth Industrial Revolution's goal of leveraging modern technology to solve major problems in various industries.							           The project focuses on enhancing business operations in the healthcare industry by automating and augmenting the capabilities of doctors in diagnosing breast cancer.
Implementing an AI-based solution for breast cancer detection will provide several benefits. First it cuts down the high percentage of wrong diagnoses thus increasing the chances of early treatment for the diagnosed patients. Second, patients get diagnosed faster so that the doctors start making decisions faster. In conclusion, it can prevent the raising of high contraction costs that emanate from doing several tests and procedures on the patients. Lastly, it will ensure patients receive the right amount of care that was needed avoiding wastage of health care resource.
